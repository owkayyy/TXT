                Remember how I used to be so<br>
                Stuck in one place so cold<br>
                Feeling like my heart just froze<br>
                Nowhere to go<br>
                With no one, nobody
                <p>Suddenly you came through<br>
                Making me make a move<br>
                Nobody got it like you<br>
                I can't look away<br>
                I can't
                <p>Cause baby you're a real one real one<br>
                Teaching me to feel something so strong<br>
                We could reach out and grab it
                <p>Oh it's just like magic<br>
                Feeling your touch<br>
                Oh it's a rush<br>
                No one else has it<br>
                Oh just like magic
                <p>Oh it's just like magic<br>
                Holding me tight<br>
                Giving me life
                <p>Oh it's magic<br>
                Oh it's magic<br>
                (Oh it's just like magic)
                <p>Oh it's magic, oh it's magic<br>
                (Just like magic)<br>
                Oh it's magic<br>
                Magic
                <p>Used to be so afraid<br>
                Fraid of all the games we played<br>
                Waited around all day<br>
                Nowhere to go<br>
                With no one, nobody
                <p>Hoping someone would save me<br>
                Till you called out my name<br>
                Something in me just changed<br>
                Got me awake<br>
                Got me
                <p>Baby you're a real one real one<br>
                Teaching me to feel something so strong<br>
                We could reach out and grab it
                <p>Oh it's just like magic<br>

                If you've got a broken heart just take a chance<br>
                I say everybody clap your hands<br>
