                Whoa
                <p>Eyes up, you've been gone for a fortnight<br>
                My love, are you stuck in a fake life?<br>
                Can't win, if the prize is to waste your time<br>
                Now it's wasting mine
                <p>And I know that we're close but I'm lonely<br>
                Make me your only, won't win a trophy<br>
                But can it kiss you like this when you hold me?<br>
                Missing it low-key, I'll say it slowly
                <p>It's me or the PS5<br>
                Tell me how you wanna spend your night<br>
                Three's feeling way too tight<br>
                So if it's not me, then I'm probably gonna run it over<br>
                Me or the PS5<br>
                Tell me which of us is more your type<br>
                Seems like you can't decide<br>
                So if it's not me, then I'm probably gonna run it over
                <p>My love, know I'm in for the long ride (in for the long ride)<br>
                I'm not playing games of the wrong kind<br>
                Could be keeping secrets and telling lies<br>
                But I'm just online, and I can promise you<br>
                I'll never play ya, I'll find a way to<br>
                Show you I'm grateful, so I'm begging you<br>
                Two minutes only, you'll get a trophy<br>
                I'm staying faithful
                <p>It's me and the PS5<br>
                Tell me why you making me decide? (Yeah)<br>
                Please, don't you see I'm live? (I'm live)<br>
                So if you don't leave, I can find a way to win you over<br>
                Me and the PS5<br>
                Least you know where I'ma be at night<br>
                Score's never been this high (so high)<br>
                So if you don't leave, I can find a way to win you over
                <p>Me or the PS5<br>
                Me or the PS5<br>
                Me or the PS5
