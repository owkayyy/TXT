                Through the valley of lies<br>
                Through the valley of lies
                <p>I'm walking through the valley of lies<br>
                I see a coffin, perfect fit for my size<br>
                They won't open, got silky stitch in my eye<br>
                I'm hurting and I lost my heart in the sky
                <p>Taking trips down uncharted roads, <br>
                them very lonely roads<br>
                Looking for a pot of gold, <br>
                your love was not enough<br>
                It don't make no sense to me, <br>
                and now you're begging please<br>
                Remember you was hurting me, <br>
                well keep that energy
                <p>I've been waiting, <br>
                knowing you won't show up<br>
                Don't make no sense, I'm not<br>
                I'm not giving in
                <p>I'm walking through the valley of lies<br>
                I see a coffin, perfect fit for my size<br>
                They won't open, got silky stitch in my eye<br>
                I'm hurting and I lost my heart in the sky
                <p>On and on and on<br>
                Keep fighting, Armageddon<br>
                Now things are getting rough<br>
                I never thought you'd be a lesson
                <p>Go, you go, you go<br>
                How come I never see ya?<br>
                I'm really getting close to giving up, <br>
                I hate the feeling
                <p>Yeah, through the valley of your lies <br>
                The water keeps flowing down <br>
                You won't believe it's all from my eyes
                <p>Thought you were the one <br>You tarnished our love <br>
                Yeah, with your liar's tongue <br>After all
                <p>You knew that we would end up this way <br>
                I never knew my love would turn gray <br>
                All our memories in my head <br>
                It's time to bury 'em away<br>
                Way deep inside the valley<br>
                It's gonna be okay, hey
                <p>Ah-na-na-na-na, ah-na-na-na-na<br>
                Ah-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
                <p>Ah-na-na-na-na, ah-na-na-na-na<br>
                Ah-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na
                <p>I'm walking through the valley of lies<br>
